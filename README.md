# Learning Data Structure & Algorithms on Coursera
This is a repository that records what I have learned from the Data Structure & Algorithms Specialization on Coursera taught by UC San Diego

The [Data Structure & Algorithm Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms?) on Coursera teaches algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems with about 100 algorithmic coding problems in any programming language of the student's choice.

The Specialization includes 6 courses, namely:

* Algorithm Toolbox
* Data Structure
* Algorithms on Graphs
* Algorithms on Strings
* Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
* Genome Assembly Programming Challenge



## Algorithm Toolbox
#### Big-O Notation
In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. Click [here](https://tinyurl.com/y9tzg6sh) for the article I wrote to illustrate the basics of this concept.
#### Greedy Algorithm
The basic pattern of a greedy algorithm starts with picking a safe choice to tackle the problem, check that the safe choice works, repeat and solve smaller problems (sub-problem) with safe choices of the same concept and finish when thereâ€™s no smaller problem anymore.

#### Divide & Conquer
#### Dynamic Programming
## Data Structures
#### Stack
#### Queue
#### Tree
#### Heap
#### Priority Queue
#### Hash Table
